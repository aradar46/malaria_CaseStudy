IMPORTANT WARNING: Alignment column 3903 contains only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences Pb and Py are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 1 sequence that is exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.


IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 1 column that contains only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data.
Normally these columns should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates and undetermined columns removed is printed to file ../11_clustlo/24788at5794.aligned.faa.reduced

Alignment has 1 completely undetermined sites that will be automatically removed from the input data
